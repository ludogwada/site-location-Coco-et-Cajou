        "review": "We really enjoyed our stay in Celine and Ludos accomendation. The Bungalow is located in the heart of the Island surrounded by amazing nature, trees, animals and friendly people. The stay is close to several beautiful beaches, art museums, surf destinations etc. We couldnt think of a better place to stay. We woke up with colibris in our garden, we got invited to have some Rum with our hosts and they always offered help and gave us recommendations when needed. We would highly recommend this clean and tidy place and hope to come back in the future."
